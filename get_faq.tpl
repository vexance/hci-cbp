                    <p>Covid-19 spreads most commonly from person-to-person contact when people are in close quarters with each other. Some infections may also be spread through airborne transmission, though data indicates close contact is the much more common cause. Also less commonly then close person-to-person contact transmission, contact with contaminated surfaces is another way that the virus can move between people. Finally, Covid-19 can spread between people and animals, though the risk for this has been determined to be quite low. </p>

                    <p>Coping with stress can be a difficult process, but there are recommendations to help manage stress and keep yourself feeling positive. To start, take a break from monitoring news stories involving Covid-19. Constantly hearing about the pandemic may be a major factor that contributes to your stress. Secondly, take care of your body by eating healthy, exercising, and getting adequate sleep. Finding time to unwind and connect (while practicing social distancing) with others to share your thoughts and feelings. If you feel as though stress levels are getting too high, please do not hesitate to reach out to a mental health provider to discuss your situation.</p>
